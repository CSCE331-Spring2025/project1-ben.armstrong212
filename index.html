                <p>I am a junior in computer engineering here at Texas A&M University. I really enjoy learning about academic topics such as mathematics, including control theory, PDEs, and perturbation method, physical sciences, such as physics and chemistry, and engineering as a whole. Outside of class, I enjoy reading, playing video games, and traveling, and I've even been to all 50 states in the US.</p>

                <p>I have plenty of experience working in teams, from school projects, to past internships, to my experience as a boy scout. I take pride in my ability to lead and guide a team to obtain goals and exceed expectations. I greatly enjoy the experience of tackling new and constantly changing challenges alongside my peers.</p>
